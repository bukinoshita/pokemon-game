- The objective of the game is to capture all Pokémons.
- Each week trainers will earn items based on their ranking. (pokeballs, money, etc) — if you need more money to play, tweet to [@bukinoshita](https://twitter.com/bukinoshita) and I put some money for you. (beta)
- The game is in **Beta**. If you find an issue or have any suggestions or ideas, please report it [here](https://github.com/bukinoshita/pokemon-game/issues).
- This project was **PAUSED** and the API is down. If you want to play the game please create an [issue](https://github.com/bukinoshita/pokemon-game/issues), I'll be happy to put the API online again if you want to play it.
